### **Data Extraction & Processing**

All insights in this dashboard are backed by a **PostgreSQL database**. The workflow is:

- üîó **Connect to PostgreSQL** using SQLAlchemy from Python in VS Code  
- üìë **Write SQL queries** to extract tables such as campaign performance, client contracts, budgets, and conversions  
- üêç **Transform data with pandas** (grouping, joins, aggregations, percentage calculations)  
- üìà Prepare clean DataFrames for visualization  

Example query snippet:  

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS employees_count, manager
FROM employees
GROUP BY manager
ORDER BY employees_count DESC;
